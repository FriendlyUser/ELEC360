# Overview
This folder contains some of my personal work for ELEC 360, used http://pdf2md.morethan.io/ to get some markdown

This does not contain files such as the lectures slides and more
Generally, it is a bad idea to store pdf output on Github, who knew

## Course Outline

**Course Objectives**

```
 Introduction in the theory and practice of control engineering.
 Understanding the mathematical tools used in control system analysis and design.
 Design closed-loop control system and evaluating their performance.
 Introduction to MATLAB as a tool for control design
```
**Learning Outcomes**

```
 Understand terminologies used in control systems
 Derive transfer functions of elementary electrical systems
 Analyze transient and steady state system response of linear time invariant systems
 Assess closed loop system performance using root-locus analysis
 Assess closed loop system performance using frequency response analysis
 Evaluate closed loop stability using Nyquist method
 Design of PID controllers and lead/lag compensators
 Utilize MATLAB to validate calculations
```
**Syllabus**

Characterization of systems; linearity, time invariance and causality. General feedback theory; time and
frequency domain analysis of feedback control systems; Routh-Hurwitz and Nyquist stability criteria; root
locus methods; modeling of dc servo; design of simple feedback systems; introduction to state-space
methods. (Prerequisite:260)

**Expectations from Students**

- Maintain a file/notebook for the course
- Attend all lectures with absolute diligence
- Do homework prior to lectures
- Review engineering mathematics & practice as necessary
- Practice concepts learnt in lectures on a periodic basis
- Dedicate about 9 hours/week outside of lectures for the course

**Assessment:**

* Quizzes (in class) 10x1=10%
* Assignments: 2x5= 10 % Due Dates: 2 - Oct-2017 and 17 - Nov- 2017
* Labs 4x5= 20 %
* Mid-term 1x20= 20 % Date: 20 - Oct- 2017
* Final Exam or Project 1x40= 40 %

**Note:**

* Failure to complete all laboratory requirements will result in a grade of N being awarded for the
course.
* Student can choose either final exam or the project option.
* Failure to pass the final exam or complete the project will result in a failing grade for the course.

The final grade obtained from the above marking scheme for the purpose of GPA calculation will be based
on the percentage-to-grade point conversion table as listed in the current Undergraduate Calendar.

**There will be no supplemental examination for this course.**
