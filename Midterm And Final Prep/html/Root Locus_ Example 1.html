<h1>Root Locus: Example 1</h1>
<h2>Transfer function</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; border-style: none; text-decoration: none; color: red; margin: 0;">

<h2><a name="BckGrnd"></a>Xfer Function Info</h2>
<p>For the open loop transfer function, G(s)H(s):<br>We have n=2 poles at s = 0, 
-3.&nbsp; We have m=0 finite zeros.&nbsp; So there exists q=2 zeros as s goes to 
infinity (q = n-m = 2-0 = 2).<br><br>We can rewrite the open loop transfer 
function as G(s)H(s)=N(s)/D(s) where N(s) is the numerator polynomial, and D(s) 
is the denominator polynomial.&nbsp; <br>N(s)= 1, and D(s)= s<sup>2</sup> + 3 s.<br><br>
Characteristic Equation is 1+KG(s)H(s)=0, or 1+KN(s)/D(s)=0, <br>or D(s)+KN(s) = 
s<sup>2</sup> 
+ 3 s+ K( 1 ) = 0<br></p>
<h2>Completed Root Locus</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; border-style: none; text-decoration: none; color: red; margin: 0;">
<img alt="RLTot" src="./Root Locus_ Example 1_files/RLTotal.png"></p>
<h2><a name="RuleSym"></a>Root Locus Symmetry</h2>
<p>As you can see, the locus is symmetric about the real axis<br></p>
<h2><a name="RuleNum"></a>Number of Branches</h2>
<p>The open loop transfer function, G(s)H(s), has 2 poles, therefore the locus 
has 2 branches. Each branch is displayed in a different color.<br></p>
<h2><a name="RuleStart"></a>Start/End Points</h2>
<p>Root locus starts (K=0) at poles of open loop transfer function, G(s)H(s).&nbsp; 
These are shown by an "x" on the diagram above<br><br>As K→∞ the location of 
closed loop poles move to the zeros of the open loop transfer function, 
G(s)H(s).&nbsp; Don't forget we have we also have q=n-m=2 zeros at infinity.&nbsp; 
(We have n=2 finite poles, and m=0 finite zeros).<br></p>
<h2><a name="RuleReal"></a>Locus on Real Axis</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; border-style: none; text-decoration: none; color: red; margin: 0;">
<img alt="RLAx" src="./Root Locus_ Example 1_files/RLRealAxis.png"></p>
<p>The root locus exists on real axis to left of an odd number of poles and 
zeros of open loop transfer function, G(s)H(s), that are on the real axis.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
These real pole and zero locations are highlighted on diagram, along with the 
portion of the locus that exists on the real axis.</p>
<p>Root locus exists on real axis between:<br>0 and -3<br><br>... because on the 
real axis, we have 2 poles at s = -3, 0, and we have no zeros.<br></p>
<h2><a name="RuleInf"></a>Asymptotes as |s| goes to infinity</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; border-style: none; text-decoration: none; color: red; margin: 0;">
<img alt="RLAsym" src="./Root Locus_ Example 1_files/RLAsymptotes.png"></p>
<p>In the open loop transfer function, G(s)H(s), we have n=2 finite poles, and 
m=0 finite zeros, therefore we have q=n-m=2 zeros at infinity.<br><br>Angle of 
asymptotes at odd multiples of ±180°/q, (i.e., ±90°)<br><br>There exists 2 poles 
at s = 0, -3, ...so sum of poles=-3.<br>There exists 0 zeros, ...so sum of 
zeros=0.<br>(Any imaginary components of poles and zeros cancel when summed 
because they appear as complex conjugate pairs.)<br><br>Intersect of asymptotes 
is at ((sum of poles)-(sum of zeros))/q = -1.5.<br>Intersect is at ((-3)-(0))/2 
= -3/2 = -1.5 (highlighted by five pointed star).<br></p>
<h2><a name="RuleBrk"></a>Break-Out and In Points on Real Axis</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; border-style: none; text-decoration: none; color: red; margin: 0;">
<img alt="RLBOI" src="./Root Locus_ Example 1_files/RLBreakOutIn.png"></p>
<p>Break Out (or Break In) points occur where N(s)D'(s)-N'(s)D(s)=0, or 2 s + 3 
= 0. (details below*) <br><br>This polynomial has 1 root at s = -1.5.<br><br>
From these 1 root, there exists 1 real root at s = -1.5.&nbsp; These are 
highlighted on the diagram above (with squares or diamonds.)<br><br>These roots 
are all on the locus (i.e., K&gt;0), and are highlighted with squares.<br><br>* 
N(s) and D(s) are numerator and denominator polynomials of G(s)H(s), and the 
tick mark, ', denotes differentiation.<br>N(s) = 1<br>N'(s) = 0<br>D(s)= s<sup>2</sup> 
+ 3 s<br>D'(s)= 2 s + 3<br>N(s)D'(s)= 2 s + 3<br>N'(s)D(s)= 0<br>
N(s)D'(s)-N'(s)D(s)= 2 s + 3<br>
<br>Here we used N(s)D'(s)-N'(s)D(s)=0, but we could multiply by -1 and use 
N'(s)D(s)-N(s)D'(s)=0.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="RuleDep"></a>Angle of Departure</h2>
<p>No complex poles in loop gain, so no angles of departure.<br></p>
<h2><a name="RuleArv"></a>Angle of Arrival</h2>
<p>No complex zeros in loop gain, so no angles of arrival.<br></p>
<h2><a name="RuleImag"></a>Cross Imag. Axis</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; border-style: none; text-decoration: none; color: red; margin: 0;">
<img alt="RLImag" src="./Root Locus_ Example 1_files/RLCrossImag.png"></p>
<p>Locus crosses imaginary axis at 1 value of K.&nbsp; These values are normally 
determined by using Routh's method.&nbsp; This program does it numerically, and 
so is only an estimate.<br><br>Locus crosses where K = 0, corresponding to 
crossing imaginary axis at s=0.<br><br>These crossings are shown on plot.<br></p>
<h2><a name="RuleFindPole"></a>Changing K Changes Closed Loop Poles</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; border-style: none; text-decoration: none; color: red; margin: 0;">
<img alt="RLFR" src="./Root Locus_ Example 1_files/RLLocPos.png"></p>
<p>Characteristic Equation is 1+KG(s)H(s)=0, or 1+KN(s)/D(s)=0,<br>or D(s)+KN(s) 
= s<sup>2</sup> + 3 s+ K( 1 ) = 0<br><br>So, by choosing K we determine the 
characteristic equation whose roots are the closed loop poles.<br><br>For 
example with K=2.25225, then the characteristic equation is<br>D(s)+KN(s) = s<sup>2</sup> 
+ 3 s + 2.2522( 1 ) = 0, or<br>s<sup>2</sup> + 3 s + 2.2522= 0<br><br>This 
equation has 2 roots at s = -1.5 ±0.047j.&nbsp; These are shown by the large 
dots on the root locus plot<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="RuleFindK"></a>Choose Pole Location and Find K</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; border-style: none; text-decoration: none; color: red; margin: 0;">
<img alt="RLFG" src="./Root Locus_ Example 1_files/RLFindGain.png"></p>
<p>Characteristic Equation is 1+KG(s)H(s)=0, or 1+KN(s)/D(s)=0, or<br>K = 
-D(s)/N(s) = -( s<sup>2</sup> + 3 s ) / ( 1 )<br>We can pick a value of s on the 
locus, and find K=-D(s)/N(s).<br><br>For example if we choose s= -1.6 + 1.6j 
(marked by asterisk),<br>
then D(s)=-4.87 + -0.243j, N(s)= 1 + 0j,<br>and K=-D(s)/N(s)= 4.87 + 0.243j.<br>
This s value is not exactly on the locus, so K is complex, (see note below), 
pick real part of K ( 4.87)<br><br>For this K there exist 2 closed loop poles at 
s = -1.5 ± 1.6j.&nbsp; These poles are highlighted on the diagram with dots, the 
value of "s" that was originally specified is shown by an asterisk.<br><br>Note: 
it is often difficult to choose a value of s that is precisely on the locus, but 
we can pick a point that is close.&nbsp; If the value is not exactly on the 
locus, then the calculated value of K will be complex instead of real. Just 
ignore the the imaginary part of K (which will be small).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Note also that only one pole location was chosen and this determines the 
value of K. If the system has more than one closed loop pole, the location of 
the other poles are determine solely by K, and may be in undesirable locations.</p>
