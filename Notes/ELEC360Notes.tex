Just like in Elec 260, I expect the main usage of Laplace transform to be limited to the single sided Laplace transform
$$\mathscr{L}\{f(t)\}=F(s)$$
$$ F(s) = \int\limits_0^\infty {f(t)e^{ - st} dt}$$
A Matlab Example: $f(t)=2e^{-t}-e^{-2t} \quad F(s)=(s+3)/((s+1)(s+2))$
\lstinputlisting[language=Matlab,firstline=4,lastline=6]{ELEC360Examples.m}
Likewise taking the inverse, can also be done in Matlab by subbing s \\
 for t and using the ilaplace function.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Some properties and Tables}
\textbf{Initial- and Final Value Theorems}
If $x(t)=0$ for $ t < 0$ and $x(t)$ contains no impulses or higher-order singularities at $t=0$, then  \\
	$$x(0^+) = \lim_{s\to \infty} sX(s)$$ \\
 $x(t)=0$ for $ t<0$ and $x(t)$ has a finite limit as $ t\to \infty$, then \\
	$$\lim_{t\to\infty} x(t) = \lim_{s\to 0}sX(s)$$\\ \

%\subsection{Inverse Laplace Transform}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Inverse Laplace Transform}
The inverse Laplace transform is defined by a contour integral in the complex plane:
$$\mathscr{L}^{-1}\{f(t)\}=F(s)$$
$$ f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi j}\int_{c-j\infty}^{c+j\infty}F(s)e^{st}ds$$
Here, c is a suitable complex number. This can be computed using the Cauchy Integral Formula. \cite{wiki:Cauchy} \\
A Matlab Example: $f(t)=2e^{-t}-e^{-2t} \quad F(s)=(s+3)/((s+1)(s+2))$
\lstinputlisting[language=Matlab,firstline=4,lastline=6]{ELEC360Examples.m}

\frametitle{Complex Analysis}
Generally speaking, the format of a complex number can be divided into a real and complex components.
$$G(s) = G_x + jG_y $$
The magnitude of a complex number is:
$$ |G(s)| = \sqrt{G_x^2+G_y^2}$$
Finally the angle $theta$ of G(s) is:
$$\theta = \arctan \left(\frac{G_y}{G_x}\right) \quad \text{or} \quad \theta = \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{G_y}{G_x}\right)$$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Partial Fractions}
{\bf Definition:} a {\em rational function} 
is a function of the form $P(x)/Q(x)$, 
where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials.  
A {\em proper} rational function is a rational function 
with the degree of $P$ less than the degree of $Q$.  

\medskip
\noindent
Proper rational functions are usually integrated 
by splitting them up into {\em partial fractions}.  

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Theorem (partial fractions):} every proper rational function 
may be expressed in the form
\[
\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = F_1(x) + F_2(x) + \cdots + F_n(x),
\]
where the $F_i(x)$ are rational functions of the form 
\[
\frac{A}{(ax+b)^k} \;\; {\rm or} \;\; \frac{Ax+B}{(ax^2+bx+c)^k}, 
\]
in which the denominators are factors of $Q$.  
The sum is called the partial fraction decomposition of $P(x)/Q(x)$, 
and the $F_i(x)$ are called partial fractions.  

\medskip
\noindent
Q1. How do we find the {\em form} of the partial fraction decomposition?  

\noindent
Q2. How do we determine the coefficients?  

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Linear Factor Rule.}  
For each factor of $Q$ of the form $(ax+b)^m$, 
the partial fraction decomposition contains 
the following sum of $m$ partial fractions:  
\[
\frac{A_1}{ax+b} + \frac{A_2}{(ax+b)^2} + \cdots + \frac{A_m}{(ax+b)^m},
\]
where the $A_i$ are constants to be determined.  

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Quadratic Factor Rule.}  
For each factor of $Q$ of the form $(ax^2+bx+c)^m$, 
where $ax^2+bx+c$ is an irreducible quadratic, 
the partial fraction decomposition contains 
the following sum of $m$ partial fractions:  
\[
\frac{A_1x+B_1}{ax^2+bx+c} + \frac{A_2x+B_2}{(ax^2+bx+c)^2} + \cdots 
+ \frac{A_mx+B_m}{(ax^2+bx+c)^m},
\]
where the $A_i$ and $B_i$ are constants to be determined. Useful Matlab functions for partial fractions \gls{partFrac} include \href{https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/residue.html}{residue}, and symbolic toolbox function \href{https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/partfrac.html}{partfrac}. \\

Obviously, I am quite experienced in partial fractions due to the completion of the following courses: Math 201 --- Differential Equations, Elec 260 --- Continuous Time Signals, Elec 310 --- Digital Signal Processing and more courses in the future.

%% Chapter 1 --- Introduction to Control Systems
%---------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Introduction to Control Systems}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Overview of Control Systems}
A control system manages, commands, directs or regulates the behaviour of other devices or systems. It can range from a home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large Industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/Ch1/conSys}
	\caption{Example of a control System with a feedback loop}
	\label{fig:consys}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Controlled Variable and Control Signal or Manipulated Variable}. The controlled
variable is the quantity or condition that is measured and controlled.The control signal
or manipulated variable is the quantity or condition that is varied by the controller so
as to affect the value of the controlled variable. Normally, the controlled variable is the
output of the system. Control means measuring the value of the controlled variable of
the system and applying the control signal to the system to correct or limit deviation of
the measured value from a desired value. \\
\hfill \newline

\textbf{Plants}. A plant may be a piece of equipment, perhaps just a set of machine parts
functioning together, the purpose of which is to perform a particular operation. In this
book, we shall call any physical object to be controlled (such as a mechanical device, a
heating furnace, a chemical reactor, or a spacecraft) a plant. \\ 

\hfill \newline
\textbf{Processes}. The Merriam–Webster Dictionary defines a process to be a natural, progressively continuing operation or development marked by a series of gradual changes
that succeed one another in a relatively fixed way and lead toward a particular result or
end; or an artificial or voluntary, progressively continuing operation that consists of a series of controlled actions or movements systematically directed toward a particular result or end. In this book we shall call any operation to be controlled a process. Examples
are chemical, economic, and biological processes.

\hfill \newline
\textbf{Systems}. A system is a combination of components that act together and perform
a certain objective. A system need not be physical. The concept of the system can be
applied to abstract, dynamic phenomena such as those encountered in economics. The
word system should, therefore, be interpreted to imply physical, biological, economic, and
the like, systems. \\

\hfill \newline
\textbf{Disturbances}. A disturbance is a signal that tends to adversely affect the value
of the output of a system. If a disturbance is generated within the system, it is called
internal, while an external disturbance is generated outside the system and is
an input. \\

\hfill \newline
\textbf{Feedback Control}. Feedback control refers to an operation that, in the presence
of disturbances, tends to reduce the difference between the output of a system and some
reference input and does so on the basis of this difference. Here only unpredictable disturbances are so specified, since predictable or known disturbances can always be compensated for within the system. \\

\hfill \newline
It is likely that many block diagrams will be made during the assignments. Options for making block diagrams are either latex, perhaps Simulink, or rudimentary drawing tools.

%---------------------------------------------------------
% Terminology Useful in ELEC 360

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Terminology useful in ELEC 360}
\textbf{Closed-Loop Control Systems}. Feedback \glspl{conSys} are often referred to
as closed-loop control systems. In practice, the terms feedback control and closed-loop
control are used interchangeably. In a \gls{closedLoop} control system the actuating error
signal, which is the difference between the input signal and the feedback signal (which
may be the output signal itself or a function of the output signal and its derivatives
and/or integrals), is fed to the controller so as to reduce the error and bring the output
of the system to a desired value.The term closed-loop control always implies the use of
feedback control action in order to reduce system error. \hfill \break

Then we can define the main characteristics of Closed-loop Control as being:
\begin{itemize}
	\item reduce errors by automatically adjusting the systems input.
	\item To improve stability of an unstable system.
	\item To increase or reduce the systems sensitivity.
	\item To enhance robustness against external disturbances to the process.
	\item To produce a reliable and repeatable performance.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Open-Loop Control Systems}. Those systems in which the output has no effect
on the control action are called \gls{openLoop} \glspl{conSys}. In other words, in an openloop control system the output is neither measured nor fed back for comparison with the
input. One practical example is a washing machine. Soaking, washing, and rinsing in the
washer operate on a time basis. The machine does not measure the output signal, that
is, the cleanliness of the clothes.  \hfill \break

Then we can define the main characteristics of open-loop Control as being:
\begin{itemize}
	\item There is no comparison between actual and desired values.
	\item An open-loop system has no self-regulation or control action over the output value.
	\item Each input setting determines a fixed operating position for the controller.
	\item Changes or disturbances in external conditions does not result in a direct output change.
(unless the controller setting is altered manually)
\end{itemize}

Generally speaking, it is too hard to reproduce the figures shown in the textbooks and in assignment questions, luckily in you zoom in close enough ~ 600 \% magnification, you can easily take a screen shot and load it to \LaTeX, like so. Other options may include simulink.

\frametitle{Procedures for drawing a Block Diagram}
As an example, consider the RC circuit shown in Figure 2–12(a) \cite[p.38]{textbook:ogata}. The equations for
this circuit are:
\begin{align}
& i = \frac{e_i-e_o}{R} \\
& e_o = \frac{\int i dt}{C}
\end{align}
The Laplace transforms of Equations above with zero initial condition, become
\begin{align}
& I(s)=\frac{E_i(s)-E_o(s)}{R} \\
& E(s) = \frac{I(s)}{Cs}
\end{align}
Equation (2–6) represents a summing operation, and the \\
 corresponding diagram is shown in Figure 2–12(b). Equation (2–7) \\ 
 represents the block as shown in Figure 2–12(c). Assembling these two elements, we obtain the overall block diagram for the system as shown in Figure 2–12(d).
\medskip
\noindent
Block Diagram Reduction. It is important to note that blocks can be connected
in series only if the output of one block is not affected by the next following block.
\medskip
\noindent
 If there are any loading effects between the components, it is necessary to combine these
components into a single block.
\medskip
\noindent
Any number of cascaded blocks representing nonloading components can be
replaced by a single block, the transfer function of which is simply the product of the
individual transfer functions.

\frametitle{Intro to space state analysis}

\textbf{Modern Control Theory}. The modern trend in engineering systems is toward
greater complexity, due mainly to the requirements of complex tasks and good accuracy.
\medskip
\noindent
 Complex systems may have multiple inputs and multiple outputs and may be time
varying. 
\medskip
\noindent
Because of the necessity of meeting increasingly stringent requirements on
the performance of control systems, the increase in system complexity, and easy access
to large scale computers, modern control theory, which is a new approach to the analysis and design of complex control systems, has been developed since around 1960.
\medskip
\noindent
This new approach is based on the concept of state. The concept of state by itself is not
new, since it has been in existence for a long time in the field of classical dynamics and
other fields.

\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{Modern Control Theory Versus Conventional Control Theory.}
 Modern control theory is contrasted with conventional control theory in that the former is applicable to multiple-input, multiple-output systems, which may be linear or nonlinear,
time invariant or time varying, while the latter is applicable only to \gls{LTI} single-input, single-output systems.
\medskip
\noindent
 Also, modern control theory is essentially time-domain approach and frequency domain approach (in certain cases such as
H-infinity control), while conventional control theory is a complex frequency-domain.

Finding the voltage at point A and B, $e_a$ expressed as a fraction of the input voltage, $e_i$
\begin{align*}
& e_a = \frac{iR_1}{1/C \int i d t + iR_1}e_i \\
& \frac{E_a(s)}{E_i(s)} =\frac{R_1}{1 / (Cs) + R_1} \\
& \frac{E_a(s)}{E_i(s)} =\frac{R_1Cs}{R_1Cs+1}
\end{align*}
For the voltage at point B, $e_b$
\begin{align*}
& e_b =\frac{R_3}{R_2+R_3}e_o \\
& \frac{E_b}{E_o} = \frac{R_3}{R_2+R_3}
\end{align*}
Since $E_b= E_a$, and $\displaystyle E_a(s) =\frac{R_1Cs}{R_1Cs+1}E_i(s) \quad  E_b =\frac{R_3}{R_2+R_3}E_o$ the transfer function is:
\begin{align*}
& \frac{E_o}{E_i}=\frac{R_1Cs}{R_1Cs+1}\times \frac{R_2+R_3}{R_3}= \frac{R_1R_2Cs+R_1R_3Cs}{R_1R_3Cs + R_3} = \frac{\left(1+\cfrac{R_2}{R_3}\right)s}{s+\cfrac{1}{R_1C}} \\
& \boxed{\frac{E_o}{E_1} = \frac{\left(1+\cfrac{R_2}{R_3}\right)s}{s+\cfrac{1}{R_1C}}}

\mbox{row 0} & * &   &  & \cdots \end{array} \]
{\bf Routh array: } The first two rows of the Routh array are composed of
the even and odd coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, respectively,
while the remaining rows are composed of elements derived from the first
two rows:
\medskip
The elements of the third row are computed as follows:
\medskip
\[ b_1=-\frac{det\left[\begin{array}{cc}a_0&a_2\\a_1&a_3\end{array}\right]}{a_1}
=\frac{a_1a_2-a_0a_3}{a_1} \]
\[ b_2=-\frac{det\left[\begin{array}{cc}a_0&a_4\\a_1&a_5\end{array}\right]}{a_1}
=\frac{a_1a_4-a_0a_5}{a_1} \]
\[ b_3=-\frac{det\left[\begin{array}{cc}a_0&a_6\\a_1&a_7\end{array}\right]}{a_1}
=\frac{a_1a_6-a_0a_7}{a_1} \]
The elements of the forth row are computed as follows:
\medskip
\[ c_1=-\frac{det\left[\begin{array}{cc}a_1&a_3\\b_1&b_2\end{array}\right]}{b_1}
=\frac{b_1a_3-a_1b_2}{b_1} \]
\[ c_2=-\frac{det\left[\begin{array}{cc}a_1&a_5\\b_1&b_3\end{array}\right]}{b_1}
=\frac{b_1a_5-a_1b_3}{b_1} \]
\[ c_3=-\frac{det\left[\begin{array}{cc}a_1&a_7\\b_1&b_4\end{array}\right]}{b_1}
=\frac{b_1a_7-a_1b_4}{b_1} \]
\medskip
The elements from the third row on are computed based on the determinant of a
2 by 2 array composed of the two elements of the first column of the previous
two rows and the two elements of the subsequent columns. Any missing coefficient
is represented by a zero.

%\begin{exampleblock}
{\bf Example 0: }
\[ D(s)=a_0s^3+a_1s^2+a_2s+a_3=0 \]
\[ \begin{array}{rrr}
\mbox{row 3} & a_0 & a_2 \\
\mbox{row 2} & a_1 & a_3 \\
\mbox{row 1} & (a_2a_1-a_0a_3)/a_1 & \\
\mbox{row 0} & a_3 & 
\end{array} \]
\medskip
For this system to be stable, we must have $a_2a_1-a_0a_3>0$.

As discussed previously, given the transfer function of a system:
\[
T(s)=\frac{N(s)}{D(s)}=\frac{\sum_{k=0}^m b_k s^k}{\sum_{k=0}^n a_k s^k}
=\frac{\prod_{k=1}^m (s-s_{z_k})}{\prod_{k=1}^n (s-s_{p_k})} 
\]
\medskip
(where $a_0$ is always assumed to be 1 without loss of generality), we 
can determine whether it is stable by checking if all of its poles $p_i's$
$(i=1,2,\cdots,n)$ (roots of the characteristic polynomial $D(s)$) are 
\medskip
located on the left plane (LP) of the S-plane, i.e., the real part of each
pole is negative:
\medskip
{\bf Example 1: }
\[ D(s)=s^4+2s^3+3s^2+4s+5=0 \]
\[ \begin{array}{rrrr}
\mbox{row 4}  & 1 & 3 & 5 \\
\mbox{row 3}  & 2 & 4 & 0 \\
\mbox{row 3'} & 1 & 2 & 0 \\
\mbox{row 2}  & 1 & 5 &   \\
\mbox{row 1}  & -3 &  &   \\
\mbox{row 0}  & 5  &  &   
\end{array} \]
\medskip
There are two sign changes indicating two poles on RP. Note that row 3 is divided
by 2 to become row 3' without affecting the result.
